Partner: N/A (worked by myself)

What Went Well
I think that something that went well was doing the challenge portion of the command line assignment


What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
Reading thoroughly
* Focus:
I was focused on only the assignment
* Communication:
Communication was okay, I asked myself questions to understand what was happening
* Pacing:
I think i might have gone a bit too fast which is I think i had issues
* Division of responsibility
I did everything by myself since I had to partner
* Code quality:
I think that my code was okay, it could have been better since I think I did something wrong along the way
